Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation 
of change (Wikipedia). RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using 
observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.
